# CPReader
A Google Chrome Extension that makes code project articles more readable

## Installation
You can install the CodeProject Aritle Reader chrome extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codeproject-article-reade/ahlafaphgbmmbiabcdecifalepbcobgl)

## Using the Extension
Once the extension is installed, you will see the extension's icon ![icon](https://raw.github.com/vincechan/CPReader/master/app/img/icon16.png) showing on the right of the address bar. Since this extension is only applicable for codeproject.com articles, it will normally be disabled. It will become enabled when you visit a codeproject article/tips page. On any codeproject article/tips page, click on extension's icon. The following popup will show.

My personal favorite is the Readable bootswatch theme togther with the Okaidia prism theme. This is what it looks like:
